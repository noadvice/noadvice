### Don't give advice until people ask for it

People give unsolicited advice when they think they know better and want to help, but they don't know - they assume. And they don't help - they make themselves feel better.

- If you find yourself about to give someone advice they didn't ask for: **don't**

- If someone asks for support or empathy: **don't** - advice is neither.

- If you're absolutely sure your advice is great and your relationship is safe enough for them to say no: genuinely ask if they want it and give them enough time to say no, change the subject, or run away.
